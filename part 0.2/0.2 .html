<p><strong>Microsoft Edge </strong>Microsoft Edge is a cross-platform web browser developed by Microsoft. It was first released for 
Windows 10 and Xbox One in 2015, then for Android and iOS in 2017,[8][9] for macOS in 2019,[10] and as a preview for Linux in October 2020.[11][12]



Microsoft Edge is the default web browser on Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, Xbox One and Xbox Series 
X and Series S consoles, replacing Internet Explorer 11 and Internet Explorer Mobile.[21] As its development and release is
dependent on the model of Windows as a service, it is not included in Windows 10 Enterprise Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) builds

Edge integrates with Microsoft's online platforms to provide voice control, search functionality, and dynamic information related to
searches within the address bar. Users can make annotations to web pages that can be stored to and shared with OneDrive,[32] and can 
save HTML and MHTML pages to their computers. It also integrates with the "Reading List" function and provides a "Reading Mode" that strips 
unnecessary formatting from pages to improve their legibility.</p>
